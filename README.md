# **PROTECTING YOUR DATA**

* Step 1: create a .gitignore file in the top level of your project directory. populate the file as shown in step 1 of the image below.

* Step 2: commit that .gitignore file (this prevents your sensitive information like your API key being shown to others). **DO NOT PROCEED UNTIL YOU DO THIS!**
